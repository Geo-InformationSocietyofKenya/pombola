        <h2>Your Role In Democracy</h2>

        <p>Kenyan citizens are expected to monitor how state officers are functioning to ensure the guiding principles of leadership and integrity are respected and maintained. The guiding principles include:

        <ul>
            <li>Selection based on personal integrity, competence and suitability or election in a free and fair election;</li>
            <li>Objectivity and impartiality in decision making and in ensuring decisions are not influenced by nepotism, favouritism and other improper practices;</li>
            <li>Selfless service based on public interest is maintained;</li>
            <li>Accountability to the public for decisions and actions; and</li>
            <li>Discipline and commitment in service to the people.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As a Kenyan citizen, you have the opportunity to hold your representatives to account in the national elections scheduled to take place in August 2017.</p>

        <h2>Speaking in Parliament</h2>

        <p>One measure of how active your MP is in Parliament is how many times they spoke.</p>

        <p>In 2015 3 MPs spoke more than 500 times!<br>
        27 MPs, however, didnâ€™t speak at all!</p>

        <p>At Mzalendo we believe that MPs from the same county should form County Caucuses to enable them collectively advance the interests of the counties they hail from.</p>

        <p>In 2015 there were huge variations in activity from county to county:</p>
